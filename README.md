# __Example: *lsm6dso_datalog_i2c*__


How to use the LSM6DSO part API.

It illustrates it by getting the values of the accelerometer (in mg) and gyroscope (in mdps) and displaying them on a terminal.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: Initializes and enables accelerometer and gyroscope features of LSM6DSO

__Step 2__: Gets the values of the accelerometer (in mg) and gyroscope (in mdps) and displays them on a terminal

__End of example__: It is an endless example that loops infinitely on step 2

You can follow these execution steps in the terminal logs:

```text
[INFO] Step 1: LSM6DSO sensor init completed
[INFO] Step 1: Enabling the ACC feature completed
[INFO] Step 1: Enabling the GYRO feature completed
[INFO] Step 2: ACC X=245 Y=130 Z=-306
[INFO] Step 2: GYR X=-45 Y=128 Z=-234
```


## __2. Example configuration__


This example demonstrates the following driver:

- Part lsm6dso.c/.h
- Part lsm6dso/interfaces/i2c/lsm6dso_io.c/.h


In this example, the LSM6DSO component is configured through the I2C IO operations defined under the folder interfaces/i2c.
Once the I2C is initialized, the LSM6DSO can be initialized too through the call of lsm6dso_drv_init() API.
After this step, the MEMS sensor will be ready to provide the values of the accelerometer and gyroscope.

## __4. Software setup__

To create a functional project, complete the following steps:
- Select the appropriate IoC2 file based on the combination of NUCLEO and X-NUCLEO boards. For example, use c562re_iks01a3_lsm6dso_datalog_i2c.ioc2 for NUCLEO-C562RE and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3.
- Open the IoC2 file with STM32CubeMX2.
- Select the preferred toolchain and generate the source code.
- Copy the main.c, main.h, example.c, and example.h files into the project folder of the generated code.
- Open the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), add the example.c and example.h files to the project.
- Add the USE_TRACE=1 to the global variables of the project.
- Compile the project.
